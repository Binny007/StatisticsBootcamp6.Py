# Cox Proportional Hazard Regression

    --> Let's discuss about the game plan for our Survival Analysis and Cox Proportional Hazard Regression. So we'll move from the 
        type of data that we had in the previous sections, we had continous dependent variable and we had binary.
    
    --> So now we'll explore time-to-event data and this is a bit more challenging as we'll go from predicting outcomes to predict
        probabilities, and predict these hazard ratios. It means, that the outcome it is likely that will happen but we don't know
        if it actually will.
    
    --> And this is a very exciting type of data and the industries that work with it are also quite different and unique.

==> Our learning objectives are:

    --> We'll start with mastering the Kaplan-Meier Estimator.

    --> Survival Analysis and how to estimate the Survival Probabilities

    --> Censoring

    --> Log-Rank Test

    --> Cox Proportional Hazards Model and how to assess Cox Proportional Hazards Model


==> So we try to find insights using this very specific type of Regression Model, to analyze the impact of multiple factors that
    influence our outcome on survival times.

==> Case Study : 

    --> When it comes to our case study, we'll examine the survival of lung cancer patients and compare their outcomes bases on
        multiple factors, based on their health.

    --> Our mission is to explore lung cancer patient data and reveal hidden insights about their survival probabilities.

    --> We will be using these powerful statistical tools like Kaplan-Meier Estimator and Cox Proportional Hazard Model to achieve
    these results.

    --> Now, as we navigate through the data, we'll explore factors, for instance, 'gender' effect these probabilities. And this 
        gives us the unique perspective on the differences that could be attained. And ofcourse we will see the statistical test
        like Hypothesis Testing.

    --> Moreover, we'll also do visualization, because it's a bigger part of Survival Analysis. And really I hope that you'll 
        appreciate their real world significance in medical research and healthcare professionals.
